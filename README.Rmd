paintR provides a collection of R colour palettes I frequently like to use in my
work. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of paintR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nathansam/paintR")
```

## Getting started

```{R}
library(paintR)
```

At present, paintR only supports discrete colour palettes. These palettes are
provided via the `paintR_cols()` function with the name of the palette passed as
an argument.

```{R}
paintR_cols("union")
```

## Palettes

This section presents a list of the palettes provided by paintR alongside short
descriptions.

### Union

Inspired by red white and blue flags but does not use exact hex values
from any flag in particular. This colour palette looks great against a
white background such as when `ggplot2::theme_minimal()` is used. However,
this palette only consists of two colours and is therefore limited to binary
cases. 

```{R, echo = FALSE}
library(scales)
show_col(paintR_cols("union"),  labels = FALSE)
```

### Pastel

A palette of 5 pastel colours. 

```{R, echo = FALSE}
library(scales)
show_col(paintR_cols("pastel"),  labels = FALSE)
```
